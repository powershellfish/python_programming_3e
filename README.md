# Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner: 3rd Edition
This repo houses all the corresponding downloads for Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner. (This goes without saying, but all content housed here is for personal use only.)

## Folder Structure
Each folder corresponds to a chapter. In each of the chapters, I follow along with the exercises, and usually modify them. Those exercises are in their original folders. If I made significant modifications, I moved the programs over to the **Exercises** folder.

## Modified Exercise Files
- Many exercise files in my repo have been modified, but not significantly.
- Significantly modified programs have been moved to the [Exercises](https://github.com/powershellfish/python_programming_3e/tree/master/Exercises) folder to make it easier for me to find what I built on my own. 
🍕>These apps will seem repetitive and at times non-sensical. I sometimes use this folder to see if I can code from scratch/memory which is why you'll often see multiple iterations of what looks like the same program.
